The videos show examples of performant robots evolved over 100 generations in: 
- the flat environment, 
- environment with evenly spaced regular obstacles, 
- environment with irregularly spaced obstacles of differing heights and 
- tilted environment
for both the objective-based and novelty search approaches to evolution.
